Geometric Shapes Calculator

This Java program allows the user to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangular tower or a triangular shape.
It provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.

---  Start
To run the program, you need to have Java installed on your system. 
You can compile and execute the `Main.java` file using any Java IDE or by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

--- Usage
Upon running the program, you will be prompted to choose an option:




- Press 1 to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangular tower.
- Press 2 to calculate the perimeter or print a triangular shape.
- Press 3 to exit the program.

--- Options
1. Rectangular Tower
If you choose option 1, you will be asked to enter the height and width of the rectangular tower. The program will then calculate and display either the area or the perimeter of the tower based on the input values.

 2. Triangular Shape
If you choose option 2, you will be asked to enter the height and width of the triangular shape. Additionally, you can choose to calculate the perimeter or print the triangular shape. The program will perform the chosen action accordingly.

--- Notes
- For the rectangular tower, the program checks if the height is equal to the width or if the absolute difference between them is greater than 5 to decide whether to calculate the area or the perimeter.
- For the triangular shape, the program calculates the perimeter using the given height and width and provides an option to print the shape with asterisks.
